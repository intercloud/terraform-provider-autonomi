# autonomi_transport_product (Data Source)

Datasource to retrieve a single transport product by filters.
If zero, or more than one, product are retrieved with the filters, this datasource raises an error.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "autonomi_transport_product" "transport" {
  filters = [
      {
        name    = "provider"
        operator = "="
        values   = ["EQUINIX"]
      },
      {
        name    = "locationTo"
        operator = "IN"
        values   = ["EQUINIX FR5", "EQUINIX LD5"]
      },
      {
        name     = "location"
        operator = "IN"
        values   = ["EQUINIX FR5", "EQUINIX LD5"]
      },
      {
        name    = "bandwidth"
        operator = "TO"
        values   = ["100", "500"]
      },
    ]
    cheapest = true 
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `cheapest` (Boolean) To ensure only one hit is returned we advise to set at true
- `filters` (Attributes List) List of filters: [location, locationTo, bandwidth, provider] (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--filters))

### Read-Only

- `facet_distribution` (Attributes) The **facet_distribution** attribute provides an overview of the distribution of various facets
within the transport products returned by the Meilisearch query. This attribute allows you to analyze the frequency
of different categories or attributes in the search results. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--facet_distribution))
- `hit` (Attributes) The **hit** attribute contains the transport product returned by the Meilisearch query.
Each hit represents a transport product that matches the specified search criteria. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--hit))
