# autonomi_physical_port_product (Data Source)

Datasource to retrieve a single physical port's product by filters.
If zero, or more than one, product are retrieved with the filters, this datasource raises an error.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "autonomi_physical_port_product" "single_physical_port_product" {
  filters = [
      {
        name    = "location"
        operator = "="
        values   = ["EQUINIX FR5"]
      },    {
        name    = "bandwidth"
        operator = "="
        values   = ["100"]
      },    {
        name    = "duration"
        operator = "="
        values   = ["12"]
      },
    ]
  cheapest = true
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `cheapest` (Boolean) To ensure only one hit is returned we advise to set at true
- `filters` (Attributes List) List of filters: [location, bandwidth, provider, duration] (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--filters))

### Read-Only

- `facet_distribution` (Attributes) The **facet_distribution** attribute provides an overview of the distribution of various facets
within the physical port's products returned by the Meilisearch query. This attribute allows you to analyze the frequency of
different categories or attributes in the search results. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--facet_distribution))
- `hit` (Attributes) The **hit** attribute contains the physical port products returned by the Meilisearch query.
Each hit represents a physical port's product that matches the specified search criteria.
If no hit is returned, an error will be returned (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--hit))
