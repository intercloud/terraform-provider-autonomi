# autonomi_physical_port_products (Data Source)

Datasource to retrieve a list of physical port's products by filters.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "autonomi_physical_port_products" "physical_port_products" {
  filters = [
      {
        name    = "location"
        operator = "="
        values   = ["EQUINIX FR5"]
      },    {
        name    = "bandwidth"
        operator = "TO"
        values   = ["100", "500"]
      },{
        name    = "duration"
        operator = "="
        values   = ["12"]
      },
    ]
  sort = [
    {
      name     = "price_mrc"
      value   = "asc"
    },
    {
      name    = "bandwidth"
      value   = "desc"
    },
    {
      name    = "duration"
      value   = "desc"
    },
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `filters` (Attributes List) List of filters: [location, bandwidth, provider, duration] (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--filters))
- `sort` (Attributes List) List of sort: [location, bandwidth, provider, duration, priceNrc, priceMrc] (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sort))

### Read-Only

- `facet_distribution` (Attributes) The **facet_distribution** attribute provides an overview of the distribution of various facets
within the physical port's products returned by the Meilisearch query. This attribute allows you to analyze the frequency of
different categories or attributes in the search results. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--facet_distribution))
- `hits` (Attributes List) The **hits** attribute contains the list of physical port's products returned by the Meilisearch query.
Each hit represents a physical port product that matches the specified search criteria. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--hits))

<a id="nestedatt--filters"></a>
### Nested Schema for `filters`

Optional:

- `name` (String) Name of the filter among **location**, **bandwidth**, **provider**, **duration**
- `operator` (String) Comparison operators. You can use the following list: **=**, **!=**, **>**, **>=**, **<**, **<=**, **IN**, **TO**. **IN** will return any products which have the values you passed when **TO** will return any value contained between the two (and only two) values you passed.
- `values` (List of String) Values of the filter


<a id="nestedatt--sort"></a>
### Nested Schema for `sort`

Optional:

- `name` (String) The name of the key used for sorting. You can set multiple name among **location**, **bandwidth**, **provider**, **duration**, **priceNrc**, **priceMrc**
- `value` (String) You can sort list ascending using **asc** or descending using **desc**. The order of the values matters as the first entry will be prioritized


<a id="nestedatt--facet_distribution"></a>
### Nested Schema for `facet_distribution`

Read-Only:

- `bandwidth` (Map of Number)
- `duration` (Map of Number)
- `location` (Map of Number)
- `provider` (Map of Number)


<a id="nestedatt--hits"></a>
### Nested Schema for `hits`

Read-Only:

- `bandwidth` (Number)
- `cost_mrc` (Number)
- `cost_nrc` (Number)
- `date` (String)
- `duration` (Number)
- `id` (Number)
- `location` (String)
- `price_mrc` (Number)
- `price_nrc` (Number)
- `provider` (String)
- `sku` (String)
